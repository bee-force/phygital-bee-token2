# To Dos

 1. Make use of the "states" & emits in smart contract, if possible make a status visible in the UI 
2. Add image Upload when minting! 
3. Integrate NFC-Tag Logic into "Confirm Delivery" Function (or another function) in Escrow Contract  - think about what makes most sense/ how this scenario could be implemented (e.g. scanning your nfc tag and then seeing the information via url, do you confirm before or after? should something be triggered in the smart contract when scanning or is that simply the proof of ownership for someone?)
4. Create this page where one can see their NFT + Info...similiar to the Homepage where you can see the listed nfts --> my purchases? 
4. After Listing an NFT the NFT stays listed on the home pagen even after being cancelled --> List Function seems to not check if an NFT is still listed or not, even though it reruns everytime
5. Should the home page be only a "gallery" of the listed NFTs or should I buy function reroute to the buy page? How do I implement this?
6. After Minting how do you know the ID number?
