# Phygital BeeToken dApp

Phygital BeeToken dApp is a prototype for a decentralized trading platform that enables users to tokenize and trade physical assets without intermediaries. This project utilizes React and Node.js for frontend development, Ethers.js for blockchain communication, and Solidity for smart contracts. The prototype is built on the Ethereum testnet blockchain, documenting the provenance and ownership of the assets.

# Features

Tokenization: Users can easily tokenize any physical asset by providing comprehensive information through a user-friendly form within the web-accessible application.

Minting: The NFT smart contract accurately mints the physical NFT and securely stores the associated data on the Ethereum testnet blockchain.
Escrow System: Buyers can deposit the agreed-upon amount of ETH into the escrow smart contract, ensuring secure and transparent payment for the physical NFT asset.

Trading Platform: Users can buy and sell tokenized physical assets directly on the Phygital BeeToken Dapp, eliminating the need for intermediaries.
