# To Dos

 1. Make use of the "states" & emits in smart contract, if possible make a status visible in the UI 
2. Add image Upload when minting! 
4. Create this page where one can see their NFT + Info...similiar to the Homepage where you can see the listed nfts --> my purchases? 
4. After Listing an NFT the NFT stays listed on the home pagen even after being cancelled --> List Function seems to not check if an NFT is still listed or not, even though it reruns everytime
5. Should the home page be only a "gallery" of the listed NFTs or should I buy function reroute to the buy page? How do I implement this?
6. After Minting how do you know the ID number?
